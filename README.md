## üéØ Challenges and How We Overcame Them  

1. **Payment Gateway Integration:**  
   - *Challenge:* Understanding Stripe's API and webhooks.  
   - *Solution:* Leveraged extensive documentation and tested thoroughly with sandbox accounts.  

2. **Real-time Notifications:**  
   - *Challenge:* Implementing Telegram bots efficiently.  
   - *Solution:* Built reusable utility classes for message formatting and API calls.  

3. **Data Caching with Redis:**  
   - *Challenge:* Handling cache invalidation for dynamic content.  
   - *Solution:* Designed a cache eviction strategy based on event-driven updates.  

4. **Secure and Scalable Architecture:**  
   - *Challenge:* Implementing role-based access and securing sensitive endpoints.  
   - *Solution:* Configured Spring Security with JWT for authentication and fine-grained access control.
